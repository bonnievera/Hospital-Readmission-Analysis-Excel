# Hospital-Readmission-Analysis-Excel
End-to-end data cleaning and exploratory analysis of hospital readmission data using Excel Pivot Tables.
	The age field was categorical, so I engineered numeric age features by extracting ranges and calculating midpoints for analysis.
	I converted categorical outcome variables into binary flags to enable percentage and risk analysis.
	I categorized hospital stay duration into short, medium, and long stays to simplify readmission risk analysis.
	I categorized patients by medication load to analyze its impact on readmission risk.
	I categorized lab procedure volume into intensity levels to assess clinical complexity and its relationship with readmissions.
	I created an emergency visit flag to evaluate how acute care usage impacts hospital readmissions.
	I standardized categorical healthcare fields and handled missing values to improve consistency and reporting accuracy.
	I standardized clinical test fields and replaced ambiguous values to improve interpretability in analysis.
	I standardized medication indicators to ensure consistent grouping and accurate analysis of treatment impact on readmissions.
	I used pivot tables to analyze hospital readmission drivers, focusing on length of stay, emergency usage, medication load, and clinical complexity, then visualized insights using appropriate chart types.
