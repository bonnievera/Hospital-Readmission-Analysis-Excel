# Hospital Readmission Analysis: Identifying Clinical Risk Drivers

##  Project Overview
Hospital readmissions are a critical metric for healthcare quality and cost-efficiency. This project analyzes a dataset of 25,000+ patient records to identify the key clinical factors that contribute to higher readmission rates. 

By transforming raw categorical data into measurable metrics, this analysis provides insights into how hospital stay duration, medication load, and emergency room usage impact patient outcomes.

##  The Problem Statement
High readmission rates often indicate gaps in patient care or discharge planning. The objective of this analysis was to answer three core questions:
1. **Clinical Complexity:** Does a higher number of lab procedures and medications correlate with a higher risk of return?
2. **Operational Impact:** How does the length of a hospital stay influence the likelihood of readmission?
3. **Acute Care History:** Are patients with prior emergency visits significantly more likely to be readmitted?

##  Tools Used
* **Excel:** Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering (IF/IFS, VALUE, MID), and Exploratory Data Analysis.
* **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Dynamic data aggregation and visualization of readmission drivers.
* **GitHub:** Documentation and version control.
